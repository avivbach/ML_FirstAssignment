## Overview

In this notebook, we aim to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa, using the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset provided by Kaggle. Our primary goal is to build a reliable and accurate predictive model utilizing Linear Regression techniques. To achieve this, we will:

Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and its features.

Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating new meaningful features.

Implement and tune a Linear Regression model, testing various hyperparameters and regularization techniques to enhance performance.

Evaluate the model rigorously using validation techniques and error metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Submit predictions to Kaggle's competition to benchmark performance.

Throughout this notebook, visualizations and detailed explanations will be provided to clearly communicate our methodology, findings, and insights gained from the analysis. Our final goal is not only achieving a strong predictive performance but also ensuring clarity and reproducibility of the entire analytical process.
